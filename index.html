    <section id="what-is-bmi">
      <h1>What is BMI?</h1>
      <p>Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on your weight in relation to your height. It helps assess whether you are underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. BMI is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by the square of your height in meters.</p>
      <p><strong>Why it‚Äôs important:</strong> Maintaining a healthy BMI reduces the risk of chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. A high BMI can indicate excessive body fat, while a low BMI may suggest insufficient body fat.</p>

      <p><strong>Healthy Range:</strong> 18.5‚Äì24.9</p>
      <h3>Health Risks of High BMI</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Obesity:</strong> Increases the risk of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases.</li>
        <li><strong>Joint Problems:</strong> Excess weight puts pressure on joints, leading to arthritis.</li>
        <li><strong>Sleep Apnea:</strong> Obesity is a major risk factor for sleep-related breathing disorders.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How to Maintain a Healthy BMI</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Balanced Diet:</strong> Focus on whole foods, fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Exercise:</strong> Engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor Weight:</strong> Regularly check your weight and adjust your lifestyle accordingly.</li>

    <section id="what-is-tdee">
      <h1>What is TDEE?</h1>
      <p>Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is the total number of calories you burn in a day, including physical activity and bodily functions. It is calculated by adding your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) to the calories burned through physical activity and digestion.</p>
      <p><strong>Why it‚Äôs important:</strong> Knowing your TDEE helps you manage your calorie intake for weight loss, maintenance, or gain. It provides a personalized estimate of how many calories you need to consume daily to achieve your health goals.</p>
      <div class="chart">
        <img src="TDEE.png" alt="Due Date Chart">
        <p>TDEE Chart</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Components of TDEE</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR):</strong> Calories burned at rest.</li>
        <li><strong>Physical Activity:</strong> Calories burned through exercise and daily activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Thermic Effect of Food (TEF):</strong> Calories burned during digestion.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How to Use TDEE</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Weight Loss:</strong> Consume fewer calories than your TDEE.</li>
        <li><strong>Weight Maintenance:</strong> Match your calorie intake to your TDEE.</li>
        <li><strong>Weight Gain:</strong> Consume more calories than your TDEE.</li>

    <section id="what-is-whr">
      <h1>What is WHR?</h1>
      <p>Waist-to-Hip Ratio (WHR) is a measure of fat distribution in your body. It is calculated by dividing your waist circumference by your hip circumference. A high WHR indicates more fat around the waist, which is associated with higher health risks.</p>
      <p><strong>Why it‚Äôs important:</strong> A high WHR indicates a higher risk of heart disease and diabetes. It is a better indicator of health risks than BMI alone, as it considers fat distribution.</p>

      <h3>Health Risks of High WHR</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Cardiovascular Disease:</strong> Excess abdominal fat increases the risk of heart disease.</li>
        <li><strong>Type 2 Diabetes:</strong> High WHR is linked to insulin resistance.</li>
        <li><strong>Metabolic Syndrome:</strong> A cluster of conditions that increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How to Improve WHR</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Focus on cardio and strength training to reduce abdominal fat.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthy Diet:</strong> Avoid processed foods and sugary drinks.</li>
        <li><strong>Stress Management:</strong> High stress levels can lead to fat accumulation in the abdominal area.</li>

    <section id="what-is-bp">
      <h1>What is BP?</h1>
      <p>Blood Pressure (BP) measures the force of blood against the walls of your arteries. It includes systolic (top number) and diastolic (bottom number) pressure. Systolic pressure measures the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats, while diastolic pressure measures the pressure when your heart is at rest.</p>
      <p><strong>Why it‚Äôs important:</strong> High BP can lead to heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems. It is often called the "silent killer" because it has no symptoms but can cause severe health issues.</p>

      <h3>Health Risks of High BP</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Heart Attack:</strong> High BP damages arteries, leading to heart disease.</li>
        <li><strong>Stroke:</strong> High BP can cause blood vessels in the brain to burst or clog.</li>
        <li><strong>Kidney Damage:</strong> High BP can damage blood vessels in the kidneys.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How to Maintain Healthy BP</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reduce Salt Intake:</strong> Limit sodium to less than 2,300 mg per day.</li>
        <li><strong>Exercise Regularly:</strong> Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate exercise daily.</li>
        <li><strong>Manage Stress:</strong> Practice relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga.</li>

    <section id="what-is-phq9">
      <h1>What is PHQ-9?</h1>
      <p>The PHQ-9 is a self-administered questionnaire used to measure depression severity. It consists of nine questions that assess the frequency of depressive symptoms over the past two weeks. Each question is scored from 0 to 3, with a total score ranging from 0 to 27.</p>
      <p><strong>Why it‚Äôs important:</strong> It helps identify depression and guides treatment decisions. A higher score indicates more severe depression, and it is widely used in clinical settings to monitor treatment progress.</p>

    <section id="what-is-due-date">
      <h1>What is Due Date?</h1>
      <p>The Due Date Calculator estimates the expected birth date of a baby based on the last menstrual period (LMP). It uses Naegle‚Äôs Rule, which adds 280 days (40 weeks) to the first day of the last menstrual period. Ultrasound measurements can provide a more accurate due date.</p>
      <p><strong>Why it‚Äôs important:</strong> It helps track pregnancy progress and plan for childbirth. Knowing the due date allows healthcare providers to monitor fetal development and ensure a healthy pregnancy.</p>

      <h3>Pregnancy Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Regular Checkups:</strong> Visit your doctor for prenatal care.</li>

    <section id="what-is-eag">
      <h1>What is eAG?</h1>
      <p>Estimated Average Glucose (eAG) converts HbA1c levels to average blood glucose levels. It provides a more intuitive understanding of blood sugar control over time. The formula for calculating eAG is: eAG (mg/dL) = 28.7 √ó HbA1c ‚àí 46.7.</p>
      <p><strong>Why it‚Äôs important:</strong> It helps diabetics understand their blood sugar control over time. HbA1c measures average blood glucose levels over the past 2-3 months, and eAG translates this into a more familiar unit (mg/dL).</p>

    <section id="what-is-ovulation">
      <h1>What is Ovulation?</h1>
      <p>The Ovulation Calculator predicts fertile windows and ovulation dates based on your menstrual cycle. Ovulation is the process in which a mature egg is released from the ovary, making it the most fertile time in a woman‚Äôs cycle.</p>
      <p><strong>Why it‚Äôs important:</strong> It helps with family planning and understanding fertility. Knowing your ovulation dates can increase the chances of conception or help avoid pregnancy.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Calendar Method:</strong> Track your menstrual cycle to predict ovulation.</li>
        <li><strong>Ovulation Kits:</strong> Use over-the-counter kits to detect hormonal changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Basal Body Temperature:</strong> Monitor your body temperature to identify ovulation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Fertility Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Healthy Lifestyle:</strong> Maintain a balanced diet and exercise regularly.</li>
